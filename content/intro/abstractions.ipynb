By introducing the idea of a special object/file, a *pipe*, you could allow programs to be combined together to do much more powerful tasks.   The **|** symbol tells the shell to create a pipe that connects the output of one program to the input of the next program. So, let's say we are looking for all programs on our computer related to Perl. The following command will be able to accomplish this task. First, it will list the contents of the /usr/bin directory.

    "So, you should now understand the abstraction of a process as a virtual computer, with CPU state and virtual memory.  A process (parent) can create another process (child) by calling `fork` which causes the kernel to create a child with a duplicate of the CPU and virtual memory of the parent.  The child, like children everywhere, can decide to be different from its parent by `exec` of a different program.  In that case the kernel looks at the program, and creates a new virtual address space by loading (potentially lazily as we will see) the text, initialized and uninitialized  data segments of the program into memory.  You can now see how to implement the core part of any shell, reading from `stdin` the names of programs to execute, and creating new processes to execute those programs.  "
